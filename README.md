Just got out of the theater after seeing Black Bag, and honestly, I'm still trying to sort out my brain. It's like a jumbled, mental Rubik's cube that someone threw against a wall. You know, I went in there with the usual low expectations you have for something named after a nondescript object. Black Bag? Couldn't they have called it, I don't know, Declassified Chaos? But here we are.

The first fifteen minutes were like an espresso shot—fast, overwhelming, and you think it's going to give you a heart attack but you're kind of into it. The main guy, whatever his name was, he had that squinty-eyed look like he's been perpetually pondering the mystery of a half-eaten sandwich. I mean, his dedication is nearly on par with that of trying to keep a straight face during a Zoom call when your cat decides to moonwalk in the background.

> There was this one scene with a car chase that felt more like a video game glitching out, like Mario Kart on steroids. Seriously, at one point I half-expected a cartoon banana peel to fly by. And the plot took turns like a dog with its head out a car window – chaotic but a little thrilling, I guess?

And they did this thing with lighting—everything's so dark and moody it’s like they 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮ed the whole   inside a black velvet bag. Which, okay, makes sense, given the title, but is it too much to ask for one or two additional lightbulbs? My eyes were straining so much I might have to invoice the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮makers for glasses. 

Random thought: if one more character popped out of nowhere with a backstory that had all the depth and complexity of a flat tire, I was gonna lose it. But weirdly, I was still invested? I'll credit it to the soundtrack, which somehow managed to be both hypnotic and jarring – a symphony of uncomfortable elevator music.

And for some reason, this is what hit me: 
``` 
void secretAgentPlot(bool goToPlanB) {
    if(goToPlanB) {
        cout << Execute mission;
    } else {
        cout << Dramatic pause;
    }
}
```
I swear, this made as much sense as half of the dialogue in the 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮.

If you're looking for something so mind-boggling that you spend the rest of the night reevaluating your life choices—or just need something to fall asleep to on a random Tuesday—I'd say 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , give it a shot. Or cautiously 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  , just be prepared for some eyebrow-raising moments. But do take heart, if nothing else, it's reminded me why I love head-scratching cinema.
